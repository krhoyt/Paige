## From Mom and Dad

- Preferred order for best sauce (mix after each): sour cream, mushroom soup, pepper, onions, butter, cheese, potatoes.
- Add an additional tablespoon of butter (bringing the total to 3 tbsp).
- The green onions are nice, but we often use 1 cup of diced red onion because they show up in other recipes for the week.
- We sometimes use O'Brien potatoes because of the flavor from the extra veggies.
- Shredded cheese often comes in packages of 2 cup increments.   If you have nothing else to use the cheese for in future recipes, then just put in the whole bag (2 cups).
- While the casserole is cooking, you can make sausage patties. To keep the patties warm, you can put them in the oven on top of the casserole. 
- Make some eggs in the last 15 - 20 minutes. The casserole can cook a little longer if the eggs are not quite ready.
