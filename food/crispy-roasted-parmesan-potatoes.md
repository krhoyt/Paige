# Crispy Roasted Parmesan Potatoes

**Preparation time:** 10 minutes

**Cook time:** 35 minutes

**Total time:** 45 minutes

## Ingredients

- 1.5 lbs bag baby potatoes (halved)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 Â°F.

2. Mix dry ingredients in a bowl (from Parmesan down).

3. Drizzle olive oil in 9x13" glass baking dish. Tilt dish to spread all over the base.

4. Use a spoon to scatter the Parmesan mixture over the base. Spread as evenly as you can. Once sprinkled, do not touch; do not try to adjust.

5. Place potatoes cut side down, pressing firmly.

> Optional: drizzle top of potatoes with a touch of oil or spray with oil, then sprinkle with salt.

6. Bake potatoes for 35 - 40 minutes or until they are soft and the Parmesan crust is deep golden.

7. Rest for 5 minutes. Then use a spatula to cut between potatoes to desired portion size. Serve cheese side up.

## From Mom and Dad

- When halving the potatoes, cut across the shortest diameter. Think of cutting a grape in half at the middle. The goal is halving the potatoes at the place where the least amount of potato is exposed. These smaller surface areas will give you a better chance that all the potatoes fit in the dish.

- No, you cannot just use a larger dish to fit more potatoes. Changing the dish dimensions, changes the oil-to-surface area ratio, and you will not get the same crust. The crust may even burn.

- Yes, you could increase the amount of oil for use in a larger dish. We never figured out the right ratio. Easier to just cut the potatoes at the smallest diameter.

- If you have a few extra potatoes, you can place them on top of all the other potatoes, with the cut side facing down (like all the other potatoes). Sure these potatoes will not have a crust, but they will bake just fine.

- The optional salt is worth it. Use olive oil in a spray bottle. Just enough for the salt to stick, otherwise the olive oil taste will overwhelm everything else. When in doubt, skip the salt.

- The instructions to not disturb the Parmesan mixture, cannot be overstated. Once sprinkled, do not touch. The same goes for the potatoes. Once the potatoes are placed in the dish, do not rearrange.
