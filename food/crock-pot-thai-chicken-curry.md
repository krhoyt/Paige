**Preparation time:** 5 minutes

**Cook time:** 3 hours

**Total time:** 3 hours 5 minutes

## Ingredients

- 1 14 oz can coconut milk
- 1/4 cup peanut butter
- 2 tbsp red curry paste
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 3 tbsp lime juice
- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- 4 cloves garlic, minced

## Instructions

1. Grease crock pot with cooking spray.

2. Whisk together sauce ingredients: coconut milk, peanut butter, red curry paste, fish sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, garlic, chicken stock, ground ginger, and crushed red pepper flakes directly in the crock pot.

3. Place chicken breasts on top.

4. Spoon sauce over the chicken, so it is fully submerged.

5. Cook in crock pot on LOW for 3 hours.

6. After 3 hours, remove chicken from the crock pot and cut into large, bite sized chunks. Place back into the sauce and stir to coat.

7. Serve immediately with sauteed bell peppers over rice. Top with chopped cilantro, crushed peanuts, and sliced green onions.

## From Mom and Dad

- Double all the sauce ingredients except for the fish sauce. You may even want to cut the fish sauce in half.
- Add a healthy portion of diced potatoes for a more hearty meal.
- With potatoes, cook on HIGH for 3-4 hours, then on LOW for another 2-3 hours. This will give the potatoes time to cook and soften, but keep from breaking the sauce.
