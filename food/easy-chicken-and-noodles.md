## From Mom and Dad

- To get cooked chicken, cube raw chicken and cook in pot with two tablespoons of butter before adding other ingredients.

- Add in two cups of diced mixed vegetables such as onion, celery, and carrots while cooking the chicken. You can get a vegetable medley already diced from the grocery store.

- A 1/2 teaspoon of pepper adds a little spice.

- While the noodles are cooking, make some mashed potatoes. Instant mashed potatoes work fine. Make from scratch if you have the time and energy.

- Serve over mashed potatoes.

- As an alternative to mashed potatoes, add a cup of rice to the pot. Also great over biscuits.
