## From Mom and Dad

- Dried beef can be hard to find. Substitute two 8-ounces packages of roast beef deli meat. Chop the meat thoroughly.

- Better a little more on the spicy side. Consider a dash more of cayenne and/or add some pepper.

- Serve like a sandwich. Put a slice of toast down on the plate. Then pour on some gravy. Then put another slice of toast on top of that gravy. Then pour more gravy over the top. Eat with fork and knife.

- Recipe will cover 6 - 8 pieces of toast. Recipe can be halved.
