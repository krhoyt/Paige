## From Mom and Dad

- Watch out for the onion size; generally half an onion will do just fine. Diced onion is best if you intend to have leftovers.
- Add a healthy portion of diced potatoes for a more hearty meal.
- With potatoes, cook on HIGH for 3-4 hours, then on LOW for another 2-3 hours. This will give the potatoes time to cook and soften.
