# Sausage Gravy

**Preparation time:** 5 minutes

**Cook time:** 20 minutes

**Total time:** 25 minutes

## Ingredients

- 1 pound pork sausage
- 1/4 cup all purpose flour
- 2 cups milk
- 1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper (*optional*)
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Place sausage in a skillet over medium/high heat. 

2. Use a spatula or wooden spoon to break up and crumble sausage as it cooks, cooking until completely browned and no pink remains. I don't drain my skillet, you want to have at least a tablespoon or up to 2 tablespoons of grease, but if you have much more than this you may wish to drain your skillet.

3. Sprinkle flour evenly over the sausage crumbles. Stir frequently until flour is absorbed (about 1 minute).

4. Slowly drizzle the milk into your skillet, stirring as you pour. Add crushed red pepper, if using.

5. Continue to cook, stirring frequently until mixture is thickened and desired consistency is reached.
    
6. Add salt and pepper to taste and serve warm over homemade biscuits!

## From Mom and Dad

- Not included in the ingredients is biscuits and eggs. Standard roll of biscuits cooked in the oven will do the trick.
