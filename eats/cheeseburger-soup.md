**Preparation time:** 20 minutes

**Cook time:** 30 minutes

**Total time:** 50 minutes

## Ingredients

- 4 tbsp butter, divided
- 1/2 pound lean ground beef
- 3/4 cup chopped yellow onion
- 3/4 cup shredded carrots
- 3/4 cup chopped celery
- 1 tsp dried basil
- 1 tsp dried parsley
- 4 cups cubed potatoes
- 3 cups chicken broth
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 cups milk
- 2 cups cubed cheddar cheese
- 1/4 cup sour cream

## Instructions

1. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large pot over medium heat; add ground beef, onion, carrots, and celery. Cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.

2. Stir in basil and parsley. Add potatoes and broth and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer until potatoes are tender, 10 to 12 minutes.

3. Melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and whisk until smooth, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk; simmer and stir until sauce is thick and smooth.

4. Stir sauce into soup, stirring constantly. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and stir in cheese until melted. Add sour cream; stir until just heated through.

5. Serve hot and enjoy!

## From Mom and Dad

- You can put all the sauce ingredients (Step #1 and #2) in a crock pot for the day, and pick up at "Step #3" when you are ready for dinner.

- If you just do not have the time to cut up the potatoes, you can use a bag of frozen cubed potatoes.

- We have experimented with Velveeta cheese in the past, and it is surprisingly good. Otherwise, a sharp cheddar will get you there.
