## From Mom and Dad

- French bread loaf, not baguette.

- May be too much onion for some. Consider reducing.

- Ribeye steak is expensive. Could easily be replaced with ground beef, turkey, or chicken.

- The cheese mixture on the french bread is what makes this recipe. It is a solid foundation for any number of interpretations. For example, ditch the meat and onion, and put pizza topings such as pepperoni sausage on top. Or just have garlic cheese bread - no meat required.
