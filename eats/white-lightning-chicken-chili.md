## From Mom and Dad

- Consider wearing plastic gloves when working with fresh jalapeño peppers. Their seeds and membranes contain oils that will irritate your skin.

- For chili with more heat, substitute 1/3 cup chopped canned hot nacho slices for the jalapeño peppers.

- Substitute 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin for southwestern seasoning mix, if desired.
