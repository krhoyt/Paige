# Wisconsin Native Beer Cheese Soup

**Preparation time:** 30 minutes

**Cook time:** 45 minutes

**Total time:** 1 hour 15 minutes

## Ingredients

- 4 slices thick cut bacon, chopped (optional)
- 1 1/2 cups diced carrots
- 1 1/2 cups diced yellow onion
- 1 1/2 cups diced celery
- 2 tbsp minced garlic (about 6 cloves)
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1/3 cup unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 (12-ounce) bottle pilsner-style beer
- 3 cups chicken broth
- 2 cups whole milk or half-and-half
- 1 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tsp dry mustard
- 1 tsp hot pepper sauce
- 12 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (about 3 cups)
- Popped plain or salted popcorn, for garnish

## Instructions

1. Gather all the ingredients.

2. Heat bacon in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, reserving drippings.

3. Add carrots, onion, and celery to drippings and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in garlic, salt, pepper, and cayenne; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute.

4. Add butter and cook, stirring constantly, until melted. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly browned, about 2 minutes.

5. Stir in beer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 2 minutes.

6. Stir in broth and half-and-half; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium to maintain a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, just until mixture lightly coats the back of a spoon, 12 to 15 minutes.

7. Stir in Dijon, Worcestershire, dry mustard, and hot sauce until fully incorporated. Remove from heat.

8. Add cheese, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly until melted before adding more.

9. Serve hot, topped with popcorn and reserved bacon.

## From Mom and Dad

- Miller Lite works best for the beer selection. Something like a Sam Adams Boston Lager will produce a very different flavor (less sharp).

- Popcorn is pretty, and tastes nice, but crackers work a treat as well.

- We usually skip the bacon because you need the drippings, and that gets messy. Microwave bacon just will not do.

- A wire whisk is your best friend for mixing in the cheese.

- This recipe is great the next day.
