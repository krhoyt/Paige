## Easy Homemade Gyros

**Preparation time:** 10 minutes

**Cook time:** 8 minutes

**Marinade time:** 60 minutes

**Total time:** 78 minutes

## Ingredients

For the meat mixture:

- 1 lbs ground beef
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp ground black pepper
- 1 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup red onion, minced
- 2 tsp lemon juice
- Oil, for grilling or frying, as needed

For the sandwich:

- 4 roundsÂ flatbread or pita
- 4 leaves lettuce
- 1 medium tomato, sliced or diced
- 1/2 medium onion, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup Tzatziki sauce
- 1 1/2 cup feta cheese

## Instructions

1. Gather the ingredients.

2. To make the meat mixture, thoroughly combine the ground lamb, salt, black pepper, cumin, nutmeg, oregano, garlic, red onion, and lemon juice in a mixing bowl.

3. Divide into four equal portions and shape into oblong patties about 3-inch wide by 6-inch long by 1/2-inch thick. Notice that the patty is shaped more like a sausage (long and thin) rather than a hamburger patty. This is intentional, to ensure the patty fits in the flatbread. Refrigerate for one hour.

4. Preheat a grill or grill pan over high heat. Alternatively, heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat.

5. If grilling, brush the grill or grill pan with oil. If pan-frying, add a dollop of oil to the pan. Grill or pan-fry the patties for 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until cooked through with crispy edges.

6. To assemble the sandwiches, spread tzatziki sauce down in the center of a flatbread round or the pocket of the pita.

7. Add a lettuce leaf, some sliced tomato, and a few thin onion slices.

8. Add the patty and fold the bread over the lamb. Repeat with the remaining sandwiches. Serve and enjoy.
