2. In a separate mixing bowl thoroughly combine remaining ingredients to make the sauce.

## From Mom and Dad

- If you are working with a small crock pot, pour half the sauce, and then mix to coat chicken. Then pour in as much of remaining sauce as will fit in your pot. No need for a second mix until the dish has started to cook.
- You can leave out the chicken stock for a slightly thicker sauce - or if you need room in a smaller crock pot.
- We like ours spicy. To get there we use 1 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes. This will yield a level-3 heat.
