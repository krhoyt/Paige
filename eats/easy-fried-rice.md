## From Mom and Dad

- This is the original recipe that serves as the basis of Daddy Rice, but it is pretty different from how we actually make it.

- From the perspective of ingredients, no peas. Add a can of bean sprouts and water chestnut to the grocery list, but add them at the end, as they tend to soften up pretty quickly.

- From the perspective of protein, we add one pound or so of cubed chicken.

- Butter all the way! Without a wok, butter is what is going to produce anything resembling fried.

- **The Daddy Way:** I start with butter, and saute the vegetables. Then I will add the chicken and garlic. When that is ready, add rice, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sesame oil, and mix well. Push some of the rice to the side, put two or three tablespoons of butter on the rice and let sit (you want it to melt, get to the bottom, and fry up some of the rice). Put some butter in the hollow space, and drop in the eggs. As the eggs approach scrambled, mix them into the rest of the rice. You can let this sit for a few minutes to crisp up. Add sprouts and water chestnuts, and fold them in and let sit for a couple minutes to crisp up a little more. You are done. My approach is very additive - building the fried rice.

- We have never let the rice cool. This results in a bit of a mushy fried rice. Cooling the rice is definitely traditional, but is also way longer preparation and more dishes.

- This makes a lot of fried rice. Use a really big pan.
