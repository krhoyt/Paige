**Preparation time:** 5 minutes

**Cook time:** 15 minutes

**Total time:** 20 minutes

## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons butter
- 3 tablespoons all purpose flour
- 1/2 cup lager beer (Miller Lite is our go to)
- 1 cup whole milk (half and half or heavy cream may be substituted)
- 1 tsp grainy dijon mustard (or regular dijon)

## Instructions

1. In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat.  Add flour and whisk until combined.  Cook 30 seconds, while whisking occasionally.  

2. Add beer, whisking continuously as you pour, eliminating any lumps from the flour mixture.  Slowly add in milk, whisking as you pour.

3. Cook over medium heat, whisking often, for several minutes, until mixture has thickened.  Stir in mustard, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne.  

4. Add cheese, a handful at a time, and stir until completely melted.  Serve warm.
