## Ingredients

Dough:

- 1 cup warm milk (~110 degrees F)
- 2 eggs, room temperature 
- 1/3 cup margarine, melted
- 4 1/2 cups bread flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup white sugar
- 2 1/2 teaspoons bread machine yeast

Filling:

- 1 cup brown sugar, packed
- 2 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon

Icing:

- 1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
- 1/4 cup butter, softened
- 1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. **Prepare dough:** Place milk, eggs, margarine, flour, salt, white sugar, and yeast in the pan of a bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select dough cycle; press Start.

2. When dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover it with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for 10 minutes.

3. Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a 16 x 21-inch rectangle.

4. **Prepare filling:** Combine brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Spread softened butter over the dough, then sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over top.

5. Starting at the longer end, roll up the dough; cut into 12 rolls. Place rolls in a lightly greased 9 x 13-inch baking pan. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes.

6. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

7. Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.

8. **While rolls are baking, prepare icing:** Beat confectioners' sugar, butter, cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and salt until creamy.

9. Spread icing on warm rolls before serving.
