## From Mom and Dad

- This recipe originally includes 1 (12 ounce) can of corn, drained. Mom is not a fan of corn in chili, so we have never made it that way. If you are looking to squeeze in some extra veggies, and do not have a problem with the corn texture, then go for it.

- This make a lot of food - it will just about fill the crock pot. The original recipe says "6 servings". It is probably more like 10 servings.
