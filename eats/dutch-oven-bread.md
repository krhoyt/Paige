# Dutch Oven No Knead Bread

**Preparation time:** 5 minutes

**Cook time:** 40 minutes

**Rising time:** 2 hours

**Total time:** 2 hours 45 minutes

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups warm water (about 100 degrees F)
- 1 packet yeast (active dry, instant, or quick rise ~ 2.25 teaspoons)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons fine grain salt (preferably not iodized)
- 3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour or bread flour (plus some for dusting)

## Instructions 

1. In a large bowl (or container), mix together the 1 1/2 cups warm water, 1 packet yeast (or 2.25 teaspoons), and 1 1/2 teaspoons fine grain salt, until yeast and salt are fully or almost dissolved (I like using a whisk for this).

2. Add the 3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour to the bowl all at once and stir together until a sticky dough forms. Do not worry about mixing it too much, just make sure everything is uniformly wet. It will be messy and sticky. You can scrape what is left on the spoon with a silicone spatula. If it seems too wet, add 1 - 2 tablespoons more flour at a time until desired texture. If it seems too dry, do the same thing with more water.

3. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel. Leave it for 2 - 3 hours to rise in a somewhat warm place until it is doubled in volume. If it is cold out, I like to preheat my oven for a few minutes, then turn it off, then place the bowl in the oven, trapping the heat inside. If your house is warm just leave it out.

4. Thirty minutes to an hour before you are ready to bake, preheat your oven to 450 degrees F. Place your Dutch oven in the oven, with the lid on, while the oven is preheating. Once the oven reaches 450, keep it preheating for another 20 minutes, so the Dutch oven gets good and hot.

5. Scrape the dough into the edge of a piece of parchment paper dusted with flour. Make it into as much of a "loaf" shape as you can by folding the edges up on top of it (a silicone spatula works well for this). 

6. Use the edges of the parchment paper to flip the loaf over so the floured side is on top and the loaf is in the center of the parchment paper. Do not worry about it looking beautiful or smooth on top. My Dutch oven is an oval, so I made an oval shape. You can do a circle if yours is round.

7. *Optional:* Use a sharp knife to cut a few slits across the top of the loaf about 1/2 inch deep, across the entire top. I did this in a cross shape for mine.

8. Take out the preheated Dutch oven and take off the lid, carefully! Grab the parchment from the sides and place the loaf in your Dutch oven.

9. Place the cover back on the Dutch oven and place in the preheated oven on the center rack. Bake for 35 minutes at 450 degrees F. Remove the lid and bake for another 5 - 10 minutes, until a golden brown color forms - longer if necessary. Remove the loaf from the dutch oven (grabbing the sides of the parchment paper works well here) and place it on a wire rack or cutting board to cool for at least 10 minutes (preferably 30 minutes to an hour) before slicing.

## Notes

- Avoid “gummy” bread by allowing it to cool for a longer time. I often cannot resist and just tear into the thing after 10 minutes, but often the inside seems gummy, and almost raw, because it is too steamy to cut into. Waiting a whole hour, if you can manage, is ideal.
- Super hard, tough bottom crust? Next time, try putting a baking sheet on the bottom rack of the oven. It will help divert some of that high heat away from the bottom of the Dutch Oven as it bakes.
- Some Dutch Oven manufacturers recommend not preheating an enameled cast iron Dutch Oven empty. It may result in the enamel cracking. I have never had a problem with my Lodge Dutch Oven, but if you’re nervous about it, you do not have to preheat the Dutch Oven. Just put the dough in the cold Dutch Oven and bake for 5 - 10 minutes longer covered, and you should be good to go!
- *Dutch Oven Size:* I use my oval 5.5 quart Dutch Oven for this recipe. There is some wiggle room, so you can go a little smaller if you like, especially if the parchment paper comes up the sides to prevent sticking. And you can definitely go bigger if you want.
- *Parchment paper trick:* crumple up the parchment before using it, to help it mold to the shape of the Dutch oven better.
- *Sticking to the parchment paper:* Sometimes using a very cheap brand of parchment paper can result in the bread sticking. I recommend using a “nicer” brand of parchment paper, or brushing or spraying it with a little bit of oil or nonstick spray before placing the shaped loaf on the paper and baking it.
- *Parchment paper at high temperatures:* I have used parchment rated to 420 degrees for this recipe with no issue, but you can buy a parchment paper rated to 450 degrees if you are concerned.
- *Avoid too much flour on the outside of the bread:* You can use a pastry brush to brush away any thick layers of flour - before baking is best but after works too! You can also spritz the outside of the loaf with some water from a spray bottle, which also can add some lovely blisters to the crust.
- *For a hard, too crusty bottom of the loaf:* Try putting a baking sheet on the bottom rack of the oven while baking. It helps deflect some of that direct intense heat away from the bottom of the Dutch Oven, resulting in a softer bottom to the loaf.
- Dry dough? If this happens, it may have something to do with the brand or type of flour, or measuring discrepancies. Jut add a little more water until it is a little looser and you should be good to go!
- High Altitude? Added a little more water to the dough (about 1 tablespoon) and keep the towel damp during the rise time.
- *Adding other ingredients:* Feel free to mix in other ingredients, like herbs, roasted garlic, parmesan cheese, etc. with the rest of the ingredients! Then let it rise, shape, and bake according to instructions.
- Dough not rising? This is likely a yeast issue. Yeast is a living organism. Sometimes, if using an old batch of yeast, or just a dud batch, the yeast is not alive anymore and will not work. Also, if using too hot water, the yeast may die and cause the dough to not rise. 
- *Testing yeast:* Add 2.25 teaspoons (1 packet) of yeast to 1.5 cups warm (110 degrees F) water, as directed in the recipe. Do not add the salt yet; instead, add 1/2 – 1 teaspoon of sugar or honey. Stir until the yeast is dissolved and leave for 5 - 10 minutes. If the mixture turns foamy and has a bready aroma, your yeast is good, and you can continue with the recipe by adding the salt and flour. If it does not, your yeast is not good anymore, and you should go buy another fresh batch.
