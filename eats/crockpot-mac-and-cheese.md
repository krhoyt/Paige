# Crockpot Mac and Cheese

**Preparation time:** 20 minutes

**Cook time:** 2 hours

**Total time:** 2 hours 20 minutes

## Ingredients

- 1 pound elbow pasta uncooked
- 2 1/2 cups whole milk
- 12 ounces evaporated milk
- 3 cups shredded extra sharp cheddar
- 1 cup shredded American cheese
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- Dash of cayenne pepper to taste
- 1/4 cup butter cubed

## Before You Begin

- **Do not use the bagged shredded cheese.** It contains an anti-caking agent that can make your mac and cheese gritty. Get the cheese from the deli and shred it yourself. 

- **Use a sturdy pasta, not the really thin noodles.** Thin noodles will cook much faster and turn to mush.

- Every slow cooker is different. Newer slow cookers should work fine for this recipe. Cook on low for one hour without disturbing. Remove lid and stir well. Replace lid and check every 30 minutes after that. **Do not** turn the heat up! You will make your macaroni mushy.

- Condensed milk is sweetened and the two cannot be used interchangeably. Use evaporated milk.

## Instructions

1. Spray 6-quart slow cooker with non-stick spray.

2. Rinse the uncooked pasta well in cold water and drain.

3. Add uncooked pasta to crockpot along with milks, cheeses, salt, pepper, mustard, garlic and cayenne pepper. Stir to combine, making sure macaroni is submerged in liquid as much as possible.

4. Dot with cubed butter.

5. Cover and cook on low heat for 1 hour. Remove lid and stir, be quick! Don't let too much heat out. Depending on your slow cooker, your dish could be done at this point or require **up to** 1-2 more hours.

6. If not done, continue cooking and checking periodically (ever half hour or so).

7. When done, pasta will be tender and liquid will be thick and creamy. Sauce will thicken even more after lid is removed and mac and cheese sits.
